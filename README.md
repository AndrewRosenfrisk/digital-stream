# Digital Stream

## About

This program mimics the “digital stream” visualization from the science fiction 
movie The Matrix. Random beads of binary “rain” stream up from the bottom of the 
screen, creating a cool, hacker-like visualization. (Unfortunately, due to the way 
text moves as the screen scrolls down, it’s not possible to make the streams fall 
downward without using a module such as bext.)
